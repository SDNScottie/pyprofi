Welcome,

want to become a Python Profi in Cisco-SDN, then look forwared to
some CodeChallenges that will help you become more proficient in Python3 and Networking.
Cisco-SDN being the long-term goal. Lets go :-)

#================================================
CodeChallenges for SDN, specifically Cisco-SDN :
#================================================

CodeChallenges build sequentially and are so numbered 01, 02, ...

Each CodeChallenge has an after action review ( AAR ), yes I was in the military :-D
  AAR's point out what implementations could have been done differently.
    Here is where fine-tuning can take place.
    
Everyone wanting to learn Python for Cisco-SDN should profit, since Cisco-SDN is also
my direction :-)

Kind Regards,
Scottie
